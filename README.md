Minishell 🐚
Re-create a shell/terminal. 
Overview

Minishell is a robust recreation of a shell/terminal interface, designed to capture the fundamental behaviors of UNIX-like terminals. While we've not emulated every facet of an entire shell, we've faithfully replicated key functionalities and commands that offer a rich and close-to-authentic experience.
Features

    Core command processing similar to mainstream shells.
    Built-in commands like cd.
    Comprehensive support for utilities such as grep, cat, echo, with multiple flag options.
    Handling of inter-process communication using pipe() for command chaining.
    Understanding and efficient usage of the fork system call, ensuring a genuine multitasking environment.

Behind The Scenes 🛠️

Building Minishell was a monumental task. Alongside a dedicated team of five talented developers, we poured our efforts over two intensive months into this project. This journey endowed us with a deep understanding of the following:

    The intricacies and behaviors of the terminal.
    Mastery over the pipe() function.
    The nuances of the fork system call and its crucial role in process creation.
    The mechanism of inter-process communication, especially data transfer between input and output using pipes.

Reflections 💡

Beyond the code, Minishell symbolizes our journey through the labyrinth of system-level programming. We didn't just replicate a terminal; we embarked on an expedition, unraveling the mysteries of operating system behaviors. The insights and hands-on experience have been invaluable, setting a robust foundation for our future endeavors.
Collaborators 🌟

Collaboration was at the heart of this project. Each member brought their unique perspective and expertise, creating a fusion of ideas that shaped Minishell. Their dedication and insight played an indispensable role in this ambitious venture.
Conclusion

Minishell stands as a beacon of our combined efforts, perseverance, and passion for diving deep into the world of systems. We invite you to explore its functionalities, and in doing so, appreciate the nuances and complexities we've tackled head-on.

Happy Coding! 🚀🎉
