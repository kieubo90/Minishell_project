## First of all: 
We need readline library to be able to run this project <br>
If you are using linux, first run this command: sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev <br>
else if you are using MacOs,  first run this command: brew install readline <br>

## Overview

**Minishell** is our rendition of a UNIX-like terminal interface, honed to encapsulate the quintessence of shell behaviors. While we haven't captured every nuance of a full-fledged terminal, our focus has been on emulating critical functionalities, ensuring a close-to-real user experience.

## Features

- Command processing akin to mainstream shell environments.
- Essential built-in commands such as `cd`.
- Support for popular utilities: `grep`, `cat`, `echo`, along with their respective flags.
- Advanced command chaining and inter-process communication.

## Behind The Scenes 🛠️

Building Minishell was a monumental task. Alongside a dedicated team of five talented developers, we poured our efforts over two intensive months into this project. This journey endowed us with a deep understanding of the following:

    The intricacies and behaviors of the terminal.
    Mastery over the pipe() function.
    The nuances of the fork system call and its crucial role in process creation.
    The mechanism of inter-process communication, especially data transfer between input and output using pipes.

## Reflections 💡

Beyond the code, Minishell symbolizes our journey through the labyrinth of system-level programming. We didn't just replicate a terminal; we embarked on an expedition, unraveling the mysteries of operating system behaviors. The insights and hands-on experience have been invaluable, setting a robust foundation for our future endeavors.

## Collaborators 🌟

Collaboration was at the heart of this project. Each member brought their unique perspective and expertise, creating a fusion of ideas that shaped Minishell. Their dedication and insight played an indispensable role in this ambitious venture.

## Conclusion

Minishell stands as a beacon of our combined efforts, perseverance, and passion for diving deep into the world of systems. We invite you to explore its functionalities, and in doing so, appreciate the nuances and complexities we've tackled head-on.
